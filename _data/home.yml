  heading: About
  subheading: I started Nita, With Love in 2017 after realizing how many retired fabrics go to waste each year (26 billion pounds of textiles and clothes, to be exact). Whether your favorite T-shirt from childhood that you simply can’t let go of, or old curtain samples from your last home renovation, my hope is to contribute to a more sustainable design future by repurposing retired fabrics into well-designed accessories. <br><BR>Made, always, with love.<br><BR>Nita
